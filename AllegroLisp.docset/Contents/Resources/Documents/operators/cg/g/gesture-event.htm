<p id="3"><b>Arguments: </b><i>
window target gesture x y distance beginning ending inertia
</i></p>

<p id="4">
This generic function is called one or more times for any touchscreen
gesture on a window, unless <a href="../r/register-touch-window.htm"><b>register-touch-window</b></a> has been called to switch
that window to the touch interface (in which case <a href="../t/touch-event.htm"><b>touch-event</b></a> will be called instead). This
function will be called once for each different position of one or
more fingers during the gesture. This is the somewhat higher-level
interface that figures out which type of gesture is being done for
you, though only five standard gestures are supported.
</p>
<p id="5">
An application can supply methods for this generic function to handle
gestures.  If a method handles a gesture, it should return true.
Otherwise it should return <code>nil</code> to pass the
event up to the parent window if any, or else to perform the default
behavior that's built into Windows.  The default method
on <a href="../../../classes/cg/basic-pane.htm"><code>basic-pane</code></a> does nothing
and returns <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<p id="6">
<b><i>window</i></b> is the window to which Windows is
sending an event, while <b><i>target</i></b> is the
window where the current gesture began (even if the user has dragged
out of that window). Initially these will be the same window. But if
the method returns <code>nil</code> and there is a parent
window, then <a href="../g/gesture-event.htm"><b>gesture-event</b></a>
will be called again where <i>window</i> is the parent
window while <i>target</i> is still the window where the
gesture began.  Similarly, if the method for that window
returns <code>nil</code> then <a href="../g/gesture-event.htm"><b>gesture-event</b></a> will be called yet again where
<i>window</i> is the grandparent window (if there is
one), while <i>target</i> is still the same target
window.
</p>
<p id="7">
This design could be used, for example, by defining a method that
specializes the <i>window</i> parameter on a dialog
subclass. If the user touches a widget on that dialog and drags
across the dialog, then each position during the drag would first call
<a href="../g/gesture-event.htm"><b>gesture-event</b></a>
with <i>window</i> and <i>target</i> being
the widget-window, in which case the default method will
return <code>nil</code>, causing <a href="../g/gesture-event.htm"><b>gesture-event</b></a> to be called again
where <i>window</i> is the dialog. You could then
handle the gesture in your method that specializes on the dialog, even
though the user intially touched a child widget.
</p>
<p id="8">
<b><i>x</i></b> and <b><i>y</i></b> are
the coordinates of the current center position of the one or more
fingers that are currently on the screen, measured in pixels.  These
are stream coordinates of <i>window</i>, which means
relative to the upper left corner of the canvas that is being scrolled
in <i>window</i> if it scrolls, or else relative to the
upper left of the interior of <i>window</i>.
</p>
<p id="9">
<b><i>gesture</i></b> is a keyword that indicates which
of the several standard high-level gestures is being performed.  This
is one
of <code>:pan</code>, 
<code>:zoom</code>, <code>:rotate</code>,
<code>:two-finger-tap</code>,
or <code>:press-and-tap</code>.  Here are their meanings:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="10">
<code>:pan</code> - one or two fingers are being dragged,
typically to scroll the window
</li>
<li id="11">
<code>:zoom</code> - two fingers are either moving closer to
each other or farther apart (a pinch or a spread)
</li>
<li id="12">
<code>:rotate</code> - two fingers are moving in a circular
manner around a central point
</li>
<li id="13">
<code>:two-finger-tap</code> - two fingers touched the screen
and were removed without dragging
</li>
<li id="14">
<code>:press-and-tap</code> - one finger touched the screen and
then another touched the screen while the first was still down
</li>
</ul>
<p id="15">
<b><i>distance</i></b> is the distance between the two
fingers, measured in pixels.  This will be zero if only one finger is
touching the screen.  For a <code>:rotate</code> gesture, this
is instead an angle measured in radians, referring to the angle of a
line that goes through both finger positions.
</p>
<p id="16">
<b><i>beginning</i></b> is true if this is the first
call to <a href="../g/gesture-event.htm"><b>gesture-event</b></a> for this
gesture, and <code>nil</code> otherwise.  The first call
is made for the first finger that touches the screen, though only
after a partial drag indicates which type of gesture is being
performed.
</p>
<p id="17">
<b><i>ending</i></b> is true if this is the last call to
<a href="../g/gesture-event.htm"><b>gesture-event</b></a> for this
gesture, and <code>nil</code> otherwise.  The last call is
made when the last finger stops touching the screen (or the last
inertia event comes in after all fingers have left the screen).
</p>
<p id="18">
<b><i>inertia</i></b> is true if this call results from
inertia after all fingers have left the screen,
and <code>nil</code> otherwise. This applies only to the
<code>:pan</code> gesture, and will always
be <code>nil</code> for other
gestures. If <i>inertia</i> is enabled for this window
(see <a href="../c/configure-gestures.htm"><b>configure-gestures</b></a>), and
all fingers leave the screen during a drag, then calls will continue
to be made to <a href="../g/gesture-event.htm"><b>gesture-event</b></a>
for a brief period, as if the user had continued to drag until
gradually coming to a halt.  An application typically can simply
ignore the fact that no fingers are still on the screen and scroll the
window according to the changing x and y values as usual, and then the
scrolling will come to a gradual halt after the user makes a fling
gesture.
