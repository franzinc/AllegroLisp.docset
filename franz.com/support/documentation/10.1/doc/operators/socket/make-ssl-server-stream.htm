You must have the OpenSSL libraries installed for this facility to
work. Note that shared library versions of the OpenSSL libraries
(required by Allegro CL) are not available on all platforms. The SSL
functionality is in the <i>ssl</i> module. To ensure it
is loaded, evaluate
<code>(require :ssl)</code>. Calling this function automatically
loads the module.
</p>

<p id="5">
This function creates and returns a new SSL server socket stream that
communicates via SSL via the given socket. Once this function is
called and an SSL socket stream is returned, no I/O calls should be
done directly to <i>socket</i>.  Note that closing the
SSL socket stream will result in the original socket file descriptor
being closed as well.  Therefore, the idiomatic way to establish an
SSL server socket stream is:
</p>
<pre id="6">
  ;; SOCK is already a socket:
  (setf sock (make-ssl-server-stream sock ...))
</pre>
<p id="7">
Unless <a href="ssl-do-handshake.htm"><b>ssl-do-handshake</b></a> is called, the secure
connection isn't negotiated until the first byte is sent through the
SSL socket stream to the underlying stream (and this will usually
occur when the first <a href="../../../ansicl/dictentr/finish-o.htm"><b>force-output</b></a> is done to the SSL socket stream).
</p>
<p id="8">
When that first write is done a negotiation process is begun that
involves reads and writes. This negotiation process will not occur if
the SSL socket on the other end of the connection is not sitting waiting
for data to arrive. Thus if you create two connected sockets in a
single Lisp process, and make one the client and the other the server,
and then write to the client side the Lisp will hang since the server
side socket isn't being read.  You can make this work if you use the Lisp
multiprocessing facility (see <a href="../../multiprocessing.htm">multiprocessing.htm</a>)
to cause the server socket to be read at the same time that the write
to the client socket is being done.
</p>
<p id="9">
The <b><i>context</i></b> keyword argument takes an SSL
context object as a value. Such objects contain relevant
information about the server stream being created. The
function <a href="make-ssl-server-context.htm"><b>make-ssl-server-context</b></a> create a context
suitable for a server stream.
</p>
<p id="10">
Note
that if you supply an SSL context object as the value of context, you
can specify values for the
arguments <i>method</i>, <i>ciphers</i>,
<i>verify</i>, <i>max-depth</i>,
and <i>prefer-server-cipher-order</i> in the call to
this function. Doing so causes the associated argument value to be
local to the connection being created (i.e. the specified argument
value overrides the value in the context object). However, it is an
error to specify values for the
arguments <i>certificate</i>, <i>key</i>,
<i>ca-file</i>, <i>ca-directory</i>,
<i>certificate-password</i>, <i>crl-file</i>,
and <i>crl-check</i> as they cannot be overridden when a
context is provided.
</p>


<p id="11">
If an error occurs, a condition of
type <code>excl::ssl-error</code> is signaled. This condition
has slots what (a string indicating what internal operation was being
performed when the error occurred), codes (a ist of numeric OpenSSL
error codes that represented the accumulated errors that resulted in
the final error), strings (a list of the corresponding string forms of
the OpenSSL error codes in the 'codes' slot) and verify-result, and
verify-result-string. The last two will be populated if possible when
an ssl error occurs. If non-nil, this information is included in the
printed representation of the condition.  This aids recognizing and
debugging certificate-related SSL errors.

<h3 id="12">
The keyword arguments
</h3>
<p id="13">
<a href="make-ssl-server-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-server-stream</b></a>'s keyword
arguments are the same as <a href="make-ssl-client-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-client-stream</b></a>'s. The
keyword arguments to <a href="make-ssl-server-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-server-stream</b></a> are:
</p>
<ul>
<li id="14">
<b><i>method</i></b> keyword argument allows control
over the SSL protocol handshake process. Supported SSL protocols are
SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1, from oldest to
newest. The <i>method</i> keyword argument can be:
<ul>
<li id="15">
<code>:sslv23</code>: (the default) the server will handle
SSLv2, SSLv3, and TLSv1. The highest protocol version that is common
between the client and server will be selected. This method allows for
best compatibility.
</li>
<li id="16">
<code>:sslv2</code>: the server will only handle SSLv2.  This
option is not recommended as SSLv2 has known security issues (such as
susceptibility to man In the middle attacks).
</li>
<li id="17">
<code>:sslv3</code>: the server will only handle SSLv3.
</li>
<li id="18">
<code>:sslv3+</code>: this is the same as :sslv23 except that,
after handshake, if the selected protocol is SSLv2, an error will be
generated. This option allows for high handshake compabitility while
avoiding communication under the deprecated SSLv2 protocol.
</li>
<li id="19">
<code>:tlsv1</code>: the server will only handle TLSv1.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li id="20">

<b><i>certificate</i></b> names a file which contains
one or more PEM-encoded certificates.  The first (or only) certificate
in the file will be used to identify the client (in the case of
<a href="make-ssl-client-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-client-stream</b></a>) or server (in
the case of <a href="make-ssl-server-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-server-stream</b></a>).  Optionally,
subsequent entries in the file may be used to supply intermediate CA
certificates (also known as a certificate chain).

</li>
<li id="21">

The <b><i>key</i></b> argument is a string or pathname
naming a file containing the private RSA key corresponding the the
public key in the certificate. The file must be in PEM format. The key
can be stored in an encrypted form which requires a pass phrase
to read, but in that case the
<i>certificate-password</i> must also be specified. If
the key is stored in the certificate file, then you needn't specify
the <i>key</i> argument.

</li>
<li id="22">

The <b><i>certificate-password</i></b> argument, if
specified, should be a string. If the private key stored with the
certificate inside the file named by the
<i>certificate</i> argument is encrypted, then this
value is used as the key to decrypt it.

</li>
<li id="23">

<b><i>verify</i></b> can be <code>nil</code>, <code>:optional</code>, or
<code>:required</code>.  Due to the way OpenSSL is implemented,
the behavior of peer verification differs for servers and
clients. Here we describe the behavior for servers. See <a href="make-ssl-client-stream.htm"><b>make-ssl-client-stream</b></a> for a
discussion of the client behavior.

<ul>
<li id="24">

<b>:verify nil</b> means that the server will not ask the client to
supply a certificate and will not do automatic verification if the
client supplies a certificate anyway.  If the client does provide a
certificate, manual verification can be done using <a href="get-ssl-peer-certificate.htm"><b>get-ssl-peer-certificate</b></a> and <a href="get-ssl-verify-result.htm"><b>get-ssl-verify-result</b></a>.

</li>
<li id="25">

<b>:verify :optional</b> means that the client will be asked to supply
a certificate during SSL handshake.  The certificate (if
supplied) will be automatically verified during SSL handshake.
If verification fails, an error will be generated during SSL
handshake.

</li>
<li id="26">

<b>:verify :required</b> means that the client will be asked to supply
a certificate during SSL handshake.  The client certificate will
be automatically verified during SSL handshake.  If the client
does not supply a certificate or if verification of the supplied
certificate fails, an error will be generated during SSL
handshake.

</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li id="27">

<b><i>maxdepth</i></b> must be an integer (which
defaults to 10) which indicates the maximum allowable depth of the
certificate verification chain.  If the chain exceeds this depth, an
error will be generated during SSL handshake.

</li>
<li id="28">

<b><i>ca-file</i></b> specifies the name of a file
containing a series of trusted PEM-encoded Intermediate CA or Root CA
certificates that will be used during peer certificate verification.
Keep in mind that, when using on an SSL server, the subject name
information for each of these certificates is supplied to the peer
during SSL handshake, so you may want to keep the number of
certificates listed in the file to a minimum. A file containing
certificates of well-known root CAs can be found in
<b>[acl directory]/examples/ssl/ca-bundle.crt</b>.

</li>
<li id="29">

<b><i>ca-directory</i></b> specifies the name of a
directory containing a series of trusted Intermediate CA or Root CA
certificate files that will be used during peer certificate
verification.  Each file in the directory should contain one
certificate.  The files should be named based on the hash value of the
certificate subject name.  If more than one certificate with the same
hash value exists, the extension must be different (e.g. 9d66eef0.0,
9d66eef0.1 etc). The search is performed in the ordering of the
extension number, regardless of other properties of the certificates.
Use the <b>c_rehash</b> (available via standard OpenSSL distributions)
utility to create the necessary links.

</li>
<li id="30">
<b><i>ciphers</i></b>: if
the <i>ciphers</i> keyword argument is supplied, it must
be a string which specifies an OpenSSL cipher list. This list
determines which ciphers the SSL server will support. The strongest
common entry from this list and the list supplied by the client during
handshake will be used. If there is no entry in common, SSL handshake
will fail and an error will be generated.
<p id="31">
For details on the cipher list format, see the CIPHER LIST FORMAT
section of <a href="http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html" target="_blank">http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li id="32">
<b><i>crl-check</i></b>: this argument controls
certificate revocation list (CRL) checking. Its value may
be <code>nil</code> (the default) for no CRL
checking, <code>t</code> for CRL checking of the peer's
certificate (if provided by the peer), or <code>:all</code> for
CRL checking of all components of the peer's supplied certificate
chain. If this argument is non-<code>nil</code>, the
verify argument must also be non-<code>nil</code>. If you
enable CRL checking, you <b>must</b> supply a proper PEM-encoded CRL,
even if it contains zero revocations.  If you do not supply a CRL,
peer verification will never succeed.
</li>
<li id="33">
<b><i>crl-file</i></b>: this argument specifies the
location of a PEM-encoded CRL file. If <code>nil</code> or
not supplied, defaults to the value of
the <i>ca-file</i> argument (if supplied).  It is
acceptable for CRL to be included amongst other PEM-encoded
certificates.
</li>
<li id="34">
<b><i>prefer-server-cipher-order</i></b>: the value
should be true or <code>nil</code>. The typical behavior
when choosing a cipher during an SSLv3 or TLSv1 handshake is to use
the client's preference. If this argument is true (the default is
<code>nil</code>), the server's preference will be used.
</li>
</ul>
